# First Basic 2D Platformer made in Godot

## For Linux users :   

### SpriteFrames not working in Godot 4.2.2 editor unless you double click the SpriteFrame field in Inspector view after its added. 
### I am using Linux Mint / Debian. This project was completed by following the free tutorial provided by Brackeys. 


## Tutoral I was following by Brackey is here : [How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)

## Downloaded the most recent stable version (4.2.2) Godot for Linux from here : [Godot for Linux ](https://godotengine.org/download/linux/)

## It is also availble through Steam. 


* I made a lot of mistakes as I went because I was eager to skip to the end , but it's worth the effort spent debugging once everything works right. 
* Contained in this folder are all project files and scipts used.
* Godot uses a language called GDScript to handle functions and call variables across nodes and scenes. 
* It is possible to use other languages with gdextensions, such as Rust,  but I have not tried this myself yet.
