# Brief explaination of the error: SpriteFrames not working in Godot 4.2.2 editor. 

## No additional scripts have been added as I only got so far in the tutorial before I encountered the issue. 

## Tutoral I was following by Brackey is here : [How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)

## Downloaded the most recent stable version (4.2.2) Godot for Linux from here : [Godot for Linux ](https://godotengine.org/download/linux/)


* I could just be making a lot of beginner mistakes and I apologise if there's already a easy fix. I am including a screenhot I took aswell. 

* I left out the .godot folder as requested by your template.
